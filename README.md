# Chat Bot

Chat Bot is a self-learning chat engine which gains the ability to ask the appropriate questions to users.

##### What went well
  - Creating a simple interface to select questions and changing their text
  - Building out the appropriate foundation to allow the app to grow

##### What was difficult
  - Selecting the structure for the question changes
  - holding back and not creating more features (json consumable api, single page app, etc.)

##### What would I improve if I had more time
  - I would make the application a single page web app
  - Add topic graphs for questions to see how one question could be related to another
